# üõçÔ∏è Pop Mart Pop Now Auto-Bot

An automated **Playwright + Chrome CDP** bot for monitoring and reserving limited-edition Pop Mart items the instant they become available.  
This script detects item availability, attempts to reserve or add to cart, and optionally sends email notifications when items drop ‚Äî all while maintaining stealth-like behavior to mimic human interaction.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Automatic Chrome launch** with remote debugging for live browser control  
- **Real-time availability monitoring** using dynamic selector checks  
- **Smart box reservation logic** that detects and clicks the best available box  
- **URL mutation & pagination** to explore adjacent box IDs  
- **Email notifications** (via Gmail SMTP) for availability and add-to-cart events  
- **Auto-reload logic** with human-like random delays  
- **Error-tolerant loops** to recover from transient network or timeout issues  

---

- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

## üîê Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
EMAIL_SENDER=youremail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
EMAIL_RECEIVER_NOTIFY=recipient1@gmail.com,recipient2@gmail.com
EMAIL_RECEIVER_ADD_TO_CART=recipient3@gmail.com

## üß† Usage

### Launch Chrome with remote debugging and start the bot:

```bash
python main.py --port 9222 --email_flag
```

**Arguments:**
| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `--port` | Chrome CDP debugging port | `9222` |
| `--email_flag` | Enable email notifications | `False` |

---

## ü™Ñ Behavior Overview

1. **Launch Chrome** in remote debugging mode (`--remote-debugging-port`).
2. **Connect Playwright** to the running Chrome instance.
3. **Monitor the item page** until it becomes available:
   - Detects ‚ÄúSold Out‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúPick One to Shake‚Äù.
   - Parses countdown timers (`Reserving Time: Xm Ys`).
4. **Attempt to reserve or add to cart** automatically.
5. **Send Gmail alerts** when:
   - An item becomes available.
   - An item has been added to cart and requires manual checkout.
6. **Auto-reload & rotate URLs** when needed to stay up-to-date.
